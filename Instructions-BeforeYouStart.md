## GWAS-QC-AI-Report

*A simple tour of what the project does, why it matters, and where it is heading*

---

### 1.  What problem are we solving?

Think of a **Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS)** as a giant “Where’s Waldo?” hunt—except Waldo is a DNA position linked to disease risk, and the picture is millions of columns (DNA variants) by thousands of rows (people).
Before any real discovery can happen, scientists must

1. **Clean the picture** (remove blurry or missing bits).
2. **Run the search** (statistical tests).
3. **Summarise what they found** (plots, tables, plain-language notes).

Traditionally these steps are glued together with ad-hoc scripts on individual laptops or lab servers. Results are hard to reproduce, QC is manual, and junior researchers spend days writing the same reports over and over.

## 2  Key concepts in 60 seconds

| Term                     | Plain‑English meaning                                                       | Everyday analogy                                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Variant (SNP)**        | A single letter in the DNA script that differs between people               | A spelling difference like “colour/color”                          |
| **Quality Control (QC)** | Filtering out unreliable data (e.g., low read depth, sample swaps)          | Removing blurry photos before analysis                             |
| **GWAS**                 | Statistical test that links variants to traits                              | Surveying many people to ask which spelling correlates with accent |
| **Synthetic Data**       | Computer‑generated, non‑identifiable DNA that mimics real patterns          | Crash‑test dummies instead of real passengers                      |
| **LLM‑assisted QC**      | Using large language models to parse logs, detect errors, and suggest fixes | A bilingual assistant that spots translation glitches instantly    |

### 3.  What does *GWAS-QC-AI-Report* change?

| Old workflow                                           | With our project                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dozens of shell & R scripts scattered across machines. | **One reproducible pipeline** driven by Nextflow and Conda.           |
| Manual copy-paste of QC numbers into Word.             | **Automatic PDF/HTML reports** generated straight from JSON metrics.  |
| Human interpretation written from scratch each time.   | **GPT-4/mini** writes the plain-English commentary for you.           |
| Everyone sets up their own environment.                | **Single Conda file** installs the exact same packages for all users. |

(*Container and cloud deployment will arrive in the next milestone—see Road-map.*)

### 4.  A gentle step-by-step tour

| Stage                             | What happens (non-technical)                                                                              | Key tool                   | Passes **to next stage**               |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **1. Data Ingest**                | Load raw DNA files (VCF/BGEN) and a traits spreadsheet into one big table.                                | Hail                       | A clean “matrix” dataset.              |
| **2. Quality Check (QC)**         | Flag flawed samples or bad variants—think spell-checker for DNA.                                          | Hail & PLINK 2             | `qc_metrics.json`.                     |
| **3. Visualise**                  | Draw Manhattan and QQ plots → figures for papers.                                                         | Matplotlib                 | Publication-ready PNGs.                |
| **4. Association Test**           | Fast statistics find variants linked to the trait.                                                        | SAIGE / BOLT-LMM (wrapped) | List of hits.                          |
| **5. Polygenic Risk Score (PRS)** | Roll many small-effect variants into one “credit-score” per person.                                       | PRS-CS                     | `prs_scores.tsv` & `prs_metrics.json`. |
| **6. AI-Written Report**          | GPT reads the metrics and writes a lay summary: *“10 samples failed QC … PRS explains 12 % of variance.”* | OpenAI GPT-4/mini          | `report_YYYYMMDD.pdf`.                 |
| **7. Continuous Integration**     | Every code change triggers a mini-run on toy data.                                                        | GitHub Actions             | Green badge = pipeline still works.    |

All steps are scheduled by **Nextflow**, the “conductor” that fires each task only when its inputs are ready.

### 5.  Why this matters

* **Reproducibility** – everyone runs the same code, same environment, same numbers.
* **Time saving** – a week of QC+report writing shrinks to one overnight run.
* **Accessibility** – labs without dedicated bioinformaticians still get pro-grade outputs.
* **Collaboration** – the clean JSON + PDF outputs drop neatly into clinical or AI pipelines.

---

### 6.  Who should care?

* **Genetics labs** needing turnkey QC/PRS without writing code.
* **Data-science teams** wanting genetic risk variables inside models.
* **Clinicians** who need a one-page QC certificate before trusting a dataset.
* **Educators** showing students a full GWAS pipeline on laptops.

### 7.  Final take-away

*GWAS-QC-AI-Report* bridges modern engineering practice and cutting-edge genomics.
It turns messy DNA files into clear, reproducible insights—automatically and in language anyone can understand.
Containers and cloud scale are on the way, but you can already run the full workflow today with nothing more than Conda and Nextflow.

This project is written by researcher with non-genetic/biological backgrounds, who is also trying to apply AI in this field:) Fork, star ⭐, or raise an issue—contributions are welcome!
