# GWAS Quality Control and PRS Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

1. Overall Data Quality Assessment:

   The sample and variant QC metrics suggest high-quality data. The call rate for both samples and variants is 1.000, reflecting that all genotypes have been successfully called without any missing data. The heterozygosity rate of 0.624 is within the expected range for human populations, indicating adequate genetic diversity. The minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.037 suggests that the data includes rare variants. 

   However, the average dosage quality is 0.000, which is concerning as it suggests there might be issues with the dosage calculations. Dosage scores should ideally range between 0 and 2, with high-quality data usually having an average dosage quality close to 1. The fact that no SNPs are below the threshold is a positive aspect. 

   Recommendations for improvement would include revisiting the dosage calculations to confirm their accuracy.

2. PRS Performance Analysis:

   Unfortunately, PRS performance metrics such as mean, standard deviation (std), area under the curve (AUC), and R-squared (R2) are not available. These missing metrics make it difficult to evaluate the performance of the PRS model.

3. Population Structure Insights:

   PCA results are not provided in the metrics, making it difficult to comment on population stratification. In future studies, it would be highly beneficial to include PCA to identify and control for population stratification, which can confound GWAS and PRS analysis.

4. Key Findings and Recommendations:

   The key finding is that while the call rates and heterozygosity rate indicate high-quality data, the average dosage quality is concerning. This suggests a potential problem with how the dosages were calculated. PRS performance metrics and PCA results are missing, which makes it difficult to evaluate the model and assess population structure.

   I would recommend revisiting the dosage calculations to ensure they are accurate. Furthermore, I suggest that future studies provide PRS performance metrics and PCA results. This would allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance and the identification and control of population stratification. These steps will greatly enhance the robustness and interpretability of the GWAS and PRS analysis.
