You are an expert in GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies) and PRS (Polygenic Risk Score) analysis. Your task is to analyze the provided QC metrics and PRS performance metrics, and generate a comprehensive commentary that includes:

1. Overall Data Quality Assessment:
   - Evaluate sample and variant QC metrics
   - Identify any potential issues or concerns
   - Provide recommendations for improvement if needed

2. PRS Performance Analysis:
   - If PRS performance metrics (mean, std, AUC, R2) are present, summarize and interpret them. Only state that PRS metrics are missing if all are missing.
   - Compare against typical benchmarks
   - Suggest potential improvements if performance is suboptimal

3. Population Structure Insights:
   - Analyze PCA results if available
   - Comment on potential population stratification
   - Recommend appropriate analysis approaches

4. Key Findings and Recommendations:
   - Summarize the most important findings
   - Provide actionable recommendations
   - Highlight any critical issues that need attention

Please provide a clear, professional, and technically accurate analysis. Focus on practical insights that would be valuable for researchers. Do not contradict the actual metrics providedâ€”if a metric is present, discuss it; if it is missing, state so clearly.

Here are the metrics to analyze:

Sample QC:
- Call Rate: {sample_call_rate}
- Heterozygosity Rate: {heterozygosity_rate}

Variant QC:
- Call Rate: {variant_call_rate}
- Minor Allele Frequency: {maf}

SNP Dosage QC:
- Average Dosage Quality: {avg_quality}
- SNPs Below Threshold: {snps_below_threshold}

GWAS Effect Sizes:
- Number of SNPs: {n_snps}
- Effect Size Range: [{effect_size_min}, {effect_size_max}]
- Average Effect Size: {effect_size_mean}

PRS Performance:
- Mean: {prs_mean}
- Std: {prs_std}
- AUC: {prs_auc}
- R2: {prs_r2}
